1.2
New:
 - methods for verifying key pairs
 - _FAST variants of the EES encryption parameter sets
 - performance improvements
 - new sample programs: an Android sample app, and a program that demonstrates
   how to encrypt messages of arbitrary length using NTRUEncrypt and AES
 - protection against meet-in-the-middle attacks on the message when df and
   dr are close to N/3 (as is the case with the APR_ parameter sets)
 - license change to BSD
 - the constructors for loading a key from an input stream or byte array no
   longer require a parameter set to be passed in
Bug fixes:
 - fixed a critical bug in the NTRUSign key generator that negated the
   security-enhancing effect of perturbations
 - NTRUEncrypt implemented IEEE 1363.1 incorrectly in two places; this has
   been fixed
Note:
   Due to some of the above mentioned changes, data produced with this version
   is not compatible to earlier versions.

1.1
This release adds the ability to deterministically generate NtruEncrypt keys
from a passphrase and improves performance in several areas.

1.0
This release adds support for product-form signing keys, fixes several bugs,
improves performance, and allows to choose what hash function to use.

0.7
This release adds support for product-form and 1+pF encryption keys, improves
64 bit performance, and adds better Javadoc. A potential bug in the NtruSign
key generator was fixed.

0.6
This release improves performance and adds the ability to import and export
parameters. Also, signing and verifying can now be done in pieces via the new
initSign/initVerify and update methods. Note that signatures and encrypted
data created with this version are incompatible to older versions.

0.5
This release improves performance and introduces API changes to make it more OO.

0.4
This release introduces some optimizations, a pom.xml, and a license change to
NP-OSL 3.

0.2, 0.3
NTRUSign was added in one of these two.

0.1
Initial release. Only NTRUEncrypt is implemented.
